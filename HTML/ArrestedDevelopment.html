<h2> The Beginning </h2>

	<p> 
		Arrested Development was formed in 1988 by rap vocalist Todd Thomas ("Speech") and 	    turntablist Timothy Barnwell ("Headliner"). The group's debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of..., was the number-one album in the Village Voice's 1992 Pazz and Jop Critic's Poll[1] and in The Wire's 1992 Critic's choice.[2] The group won two Grammy Awards in 1993 for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, and were also named Band of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine. 
	</p>

<h2> The Breakthrough </h2>

	<p> 
		A few months later, the group was approached by film director Spike Lee, to compose a song for his upcoming biopic based on the life of Malcolm X. The group then recorded "Revolution", which appeared on the oldies-dominated soundtrack for the film, as well as the second half of its closing credits when the film was released in 1992.
	</p>

<h2> Short-Lived Success </h2>

	<p>
		Their 1994 follow-up Zingalamaduni, wasn't as successful and sold poorly. After the group broke up due to "creative differences" in 1996, Speech released a solo album; sales were poor in the United States but better in Japan. The group reunited in 2000 and has been touring and releasing records via Speech's Vagabond Productions and Speech Music. While Arrested Development has struggled to regain a following in the United States, they have met consistent success in Japan.[citation needed] Aerle Taree didn't return to Arrested Development because of vocal problems and DJ Headliner refused to rejoin the band due to business differences between himself and Speech.[3] Today Aerle is a poet and converted from Buddhism to Christianity.[4] DJ Headliner has since gone on to start his own business called Creative Royalty Group.[5] In 2010 Baba Oje had a stroke.

<h2> I Only Like One Song </h2>

	<p>
		The only song that I love by this band was "Tennessee". I know that does qualify me as a fan,
		however, they are loved across the world (mainly in Japan) and I fell in love with their 
		overall fashion sense and sound when I was a little girl. I was in the second grade when this
		song hit the music airwaves, so I was not capaable of formulating my own rolodex of favorited music.
